Hello :D ;)


I listened to an interesting podcast today.
It was about tribal psychology on a show called "You Are Not So Smart". This is sad because I am really, really smart. I was extremely offended!

Decades of research shows that intense conflicts stem from a tribal mindset where you favour your own group and view an individual in a different group as an outgroup member instead of an actual person. It is suggested that this is a natural human thing to do and it debunks the old theory that aggressive personalities tend to rise to power.

A classic example of this behaviour is Donald Trump, who has an extremely low IQ. Piers Morgan is also a poopoo
